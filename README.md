# The CVBDL R package

We implement an R package to perform simultaneous coefficient estimation and model selection for logistic regression problems using Reverse Collapsed Variational Bayes methods.

More information can be found at <url>http://thomas-hy-zheng.github.io/research/vb-full</url>.

To install the package, open <code>R</code> in the appropriate namespace, and run <code>install.packages("cvbdl_0.1.0.tar")</code>. 

Included is the logistic regression solver, and a few methods to help with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
